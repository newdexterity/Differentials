**Title:** A Compact, Adaptive, Series Elastic Differential Mechanism for Grippers and Hands

**Description:** 
<p align="justify"> For certain applications we need to minimize the number of motors in robotic hands and grippers. It can be due to limitations on space, weight, or cost. Differentials are important parts when one power input needs to be distributed between different outputs. Differentials in robotic hands and grippers are employed in order to reduce the number of motors and make the device underactuated. Some of the desired characteristics of differentials are being power efficient, compact, compliant, and lightweight at the same time. Most of the current differentials lack at least one of these attributes. In this paper, we focus on the design, modeling and development of a compact adaptive series elastic differential with four outputs. The proposed differential mechanism consists of four elastic modules, four output attachments, and a main body. The differential mechanism is experimentally validated using two different types of experiments, measuring: i) the maximum achievable tension load at the outputs, and ii) the maximum achievable compliance with the proposed differential when other outputs are being blocked. Finally,the proposed differential has been employed for the development of a for finger gripper, and its efficiency has been assessed by executing grasping tasks with everyday life objects. The device can be easily replicated by using additive manufacturing techniques and of the shelf materials and it is disseminated in an open-source manner.  </p>
