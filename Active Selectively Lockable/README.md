The CAD files of the active selectively lockable mechanism and the implementation into a prosthetic hand can be found in the above files.

# Introduction 
Over the last decade, adaptive tendon driven devices have gained increased interest from the research community for their lightweight, compact, and affordable design features attributed to the utilisation of underactuation, differential mechanisms, and structural compliance. Although adaptive tendon driven devices are capable of efficiently executing stable grasps under significant object pose uncertainties with simplistic control algorithms, they lack the controllability over individual fingers in comparison to traditional fully actuated designs. In this repo, you will find the CAD files of the active selectively lockable mechanism that is powered through a small and low torque 9 gram servo to provide increased autonomy to highly underactuated, and adaptive prosthetic hands, while not compromising the weight, the cost, and the compactness of the device.
